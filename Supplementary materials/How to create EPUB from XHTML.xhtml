    Once you have the directory of files named how you want it, you should use a Zip archive program
    to zip the directory. <br/>

    My sample directory ends up as a zip file named “How to Build a Website - Jennifer Kyrnin.zip”
</p>

    Finally, change the file name extension from .zip to .epub. Your operating system may protest,
    but go ahead with it. <br/>

    Open it in an epub reader like Calibre. And if it doesn't display correctly,
    you can use Calibre to correct problems.
